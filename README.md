# `ItsTime`: Instruments in Time Series

In this code, we provide a python implementation of Conditional Instrumental Variables (IV) and Nuisance IV for estimation of causal effect in vector autoregressive processes, as described in the paper [insert arxiv link]().

See [`example_estimation.py`](example_estimation.py) for an simple example of how to use either plain vanilla estimators, or setup more involved conditional and nuisance IV estimations.
